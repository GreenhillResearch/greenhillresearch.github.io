      <h1>Message from Managing Partner Jignesh Davda</h1>
      <p class="date">Feb 11, 2023</p>
      <p>I don't think I've ever spent so much time trying to write a blog post.</p>
      <p>My idea was to convey that I intend to focus my energy on a Blockchain venture. I've explored various options before deciding that the Blockchain venture was the best way to go.This came about as I spent the last year evaluating a multitude of options to ambitiously try and sustain our current rate of growth.</p>
      <p>My first instinct was to go into an unregulated industry. After all, unregulated industries such as Crypto and Vaping have done well in the past. I researched the Cannabis industry in Thailand and even met incredible people who had a lot of potential.</p>
      <p>But the more I researched this, the more I realized we were late entrants to the game; there are a lot of players in this industryand it's so far from my current industry. More importantly, I couldn't get behind the ethics side of things. And I also started considering that this kind of move would derail the longer-term plans I have both on a personal level as well as from a business perspective.</p>
      <p> Lucky for me, I have an excellent circle of friends and family that have steered me back on the right path.</p>
      <p>I'm really excited about the Blockchain venture, and I will try and outline my plan of action.</p>
      <h2> What I'm focusing on in Q1 2023</h2>
      <p>There are three things I am prioritizing this quarter:</p>
      <h3>Communication</h3>
      <p>In the quant industry everything is kept secret and therefore we did not consider investing into a website or to start social media. We will need to adapt to shine a small spotlight on the Blockchain project so that smarter and brighter people than I have an opportunity to see what we are doing and collaborate if they wish.</p>
      <h3>Talent Acquisition</h3>
      <p>This was a challenge on the quant side of things. I tried to hire contract developers but did not succeed and I'm back at the drawing board</p>
      <p>Incidentally, the Blockchain venture stemmed out of the process of trying to create a framework to onboard talent more efficiently.</p>
      <p>I'm currently doing research and experimenting so that we can incentivize our collaborators to align with our vision.</p>
      <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
      <p>In the past, I would not have thought this needed mention. I do see the value of a work life balance and similar to how we incentivize employees to perform at their optimum I need to set up a care structure for myself. You have heard it said many times before a flight, put the air mask on yourself before someone else. Personally I can not help but think fondly of my father, a man who made a career for himself in an industry where everyone told him he would fail and is still revered highly although he has been retired for over a decade. These days I don&rsquo;t want to talk business with him. Life is too short and there are other things that are more important. But I know if I asked him for advice he would tell me the following Pay the right people to do the job rather than trying to do it yourself Make sure you treat all your clients and collaborators with respect and let them know you appreciate them Work hard but also take the time to enjoy the fruits of your labor</p>
      <p>I will be working out of Bangkok for the next month and am in search of a personal trainer, a nutritionist, a personal assistant, and a badminton coach. If you have suggestions, please contact me.</p>
      <h2>Regulation</h2>
      <p>During my month in Bangkok, I will talk with various people to determine what kind of headwinds we are likely to face.Regulation is at the top of my mind.  I decided to speak to an expert in the industry who has evaluated our risks. We have spoken over the phone and in a short period of time he has already been very helpful..At this time, this person has not committed to working with us full-time as he is doing it informally, more as a personal favor. Even though we are in the early stages, I see him as an invaluable team member and hope to have him join our team on a more permanent basis.</p>
      <h2>Open Positions</h2>
      <p>We are currently recruiting. I am looking for self-starters who are comfortable being macro managed. These positions will be WFH, although a co-working space can be provided if needed. I am looking to expand the team in the following positions:  for</p>
      <p><strong>Communications consultant</strong>
        <br />
        Handle communications in various lengths and complexity in a clear, concise, and professional manner. The main responsibility will be to draw up and communicate major announcements externally and handly internal communication processes to ensure a smooth flow of information.</p>
      <p><strong>Social media consultant</strong>
        <br /> 
        This role focuses on creating and overseeing media accounts and in charge of administration of our social media marketing and advertising. The main responsibility will be to develop and implement a corporate social media strategy.</p>
      <p><strong>Blockchain consultant</strong>
        <br />This position seeks an expert to do a feasibility study on the project and identify opportunities to create tailored solutions to the project&rsquo;s needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Research analyst</strong>
        <br />  Conduct primary and secondary research to study failures in the crypto industry like SBF &amp; Do Kwan in order to evaluate risks. Research analyst must have extensive background in our market and possess exceptional organization and communication skills to process information and effectively convey it.</p>
      <p><strong>Lastly, Management</strong>
        For Greenhill Research - this position is intended to groom someone for the CEO position if we can maintain growth. For the Blockchain venture - the same as above</p>
      <p>Trust is an important aspect for me therefore priority will be given internally.</p>
      <h2>What I'm not looking to do</h2>
      <p>There is a lot that I will no longer be able to dedicate time towards, as I focus on getting the right people together to create teams for both Greenhill Research and the Blockchain venture.</p>
      <p>f you would like to learn more about quantitative trading, read the articles at <a href="https://www.algotrading101.com" target="_blank">www.algotrading101.com</a> as I unfortunately will not be able to continue providing guidance to aspiring quants. I have personally written a lot of articles for that website and I think it is a good starting point for anyone looking to get into that industry.</p>
      <p>Further, as much as I enjoy writing, this will be the last communication you will see for me for a while. There are people that can do a far better job than I can. My sister is one of them. I asked her to edit some documents only to find out she is a much better writer than me. Who knew?</p>
      <p>Lastly, I won&rsquo;t open any new trades over the next 3 months. If you&rsquo;re curious to know what positions I&rsquo;m holding, send me a note. Hint - I&rsquo;m extremely bullish on Thailand.</p>
      <h2>Final Words</h2>
      <p>I'm still trying to see how the Blockchain venture ties into Greenhill Research. I have a few ideas, but also have to evaluate conflicts of interest in two overlapping yet distinct ventures. This may put me in a situation where I will need to step down from Greenhill Research, and it's something I will need to carefully consider after the due diligence period.</p>
      <p>To conclude, this year promises to be an exciting one for both Greenhill Research and myself personally. And I hope at least a few people reading this are charged and ready to collaborate on what I believe will be the biggest venture I have ever taken on.</p>
