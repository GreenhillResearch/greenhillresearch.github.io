<p><strong>Greenhill Research Announces Intentions of Funding a Crypto Project in Thailand</strong> - Feb 7, 2023</p>
<p>The past year has certainly been an interesting one. Many quant firms went under and it was a scary time. We had
	anticipated bad times to come, and adjusted parameters accordingly.</p>
<p>With some luck and faith, we pulled through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenhill Research posted a gain every month in 2022, despite some major risk events that took place.</p>
<p>Much of this has to do with the way the company is structured in terms of its services. Specifically, the fact that
	we don't trade our own money.</p>
<p>This led to an entirely different problem. We had cash sitting in our bank, losing purchase power.</p>
<p>I looked into ventures ranging anywhere from Real estate to bonds. They offer decent returns but barely keep up with
	inflation and don't come anywhere close to matching what I think I am capable of.</p>
<p>I've been pondering the best use of our idle capital for nearly a year now. In that time I've also observed a shift
	in the marketplace and new emerging trends.</p>
<p>Big tech companies are laying off staff but it doesn't seem like many are extremely eager to look for new jobs.</p>
<p>Rather, I see the post-covid travel trend remains in full effect.</p>
<p>We already struggle to attract good talent. And need to find a solution otherwise we can't grow.<br /></p>
<p>It happens to be that there are a lot of talented individuals in my inner circle. These are self-starters, with a
	great attitude that I think would give it their all given the opportunity.</p>
<p>I've spent the last few weeks listening to their needs and trying to figure out how to best motivate them. And what
	kind of innovation we can use to entice them to colloborate with us.<br /></p>
<p>I certainly underestimated this task. But this led me to discover an opportunity.</p>
<p>I'd like to make a open-source framework that facilitates the funding of Entrepreneurs, run on Blockchain.</p>
<p>An MVP of the white paper will be coming in due time. but for now, here is what we are trying to do.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of challenges in connecting Entrepreneurs with the resources they require. And we intend to build
	a framework around it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Streamline the process of discovering what motivates the Entrepreneur the most</li>
	<li>Facilitate an easy, transparent, and safe way to transfer funds</li>
	<li>Smart contracts for KPIs.</li>
	<li>Streamline communication amongs team members.</li>
	<li>Free collaboration tools</li>
</ul>
<p>I think Thailand is the best place to launch this project. The crypto scene is vibrant and I frequently hear hopeful
	defi pitches while here.</p>
<p>The infrastructure is what appeals to me the most. I think Thailand is well prepared for the period to come.</p>
<p>I have a meeting scheduled with Thailand's leading crypto exchange, Bitkub, next week. I will be talking with the
	Board of Investment Thailand while in Bangkok as well.</p>
<p>I hope my upcoming trip will shed some light on the types of tailwinds can expect in terms of regulation.</p>
<p>Greenhill Research will be writing algorithms to trade these tokens. Priority will be given to existing clients. More
	details on the actions we will take to ensure price stability to follow.</p>
<p>I've already reached out to a handful of people that have shown an interest in the Cannabis industry in Thailand. We
	are going to make this the test case for the Blockchain project. And I plan to write an article titled "Greenhill
	Research outperforms the market with alternative investments using an open-source blockchain tool".</p>
<p>Further, I've requested that everyone involved document their experience in some way or another on our new blog. In
	the interest of transparency, and open-source/Blockchain nature. Also, I think it will make for fantastic content
	for my site. I know I will enjoy reading it for sure.</p>
<p>I'll do a follow-up next week with more details and an update on my progression. If anyone has any questions or
	feedback, you know how to contact me.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm ready to write some code.</p>



<p><strong>Update #1</strong> - Feb 7, 2023</p>

<p>Just to reiterate - this is a rough draft. Also, the website/font etc will be improved in due time</p>

<p>I've already received good feedback. This is what I'm working on next</p>

<ul>
	<li>Clarifying the business model</li>
	<li>How Greenhill Research Stands to benefit</li>
	<li>How exactly are we helping Entrepreneurs</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a clear vision of what I'm trying to do, just having some difficulty articulating it in a precise and concise
	manner</p>
<p>Will continue to use this format of updating this article as I receive more feedback. This way there is a record of
	the colloboration that took place to get to this point.</p>

<p><strong>Update #2</strong> - Feb 7, 2023</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">As some of you might know, I&#39;ve been keeping a close eye on the Cannabis industry in
		Thailand.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">I see a lot of opportunities there. Unregulated markets tend to accompany outsized
		returns. A good example is the Crypto industry or the Vaping industry before that.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">Both those industries had periods where it was lucrative to be involved.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">However, assembling a team is not always an easy task.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">If you are well-connected, it might be easier to find the right people. But if you&#39;re
		a location-independent quant like myself, you might not know the right people.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">The other problem I had, while I was trying to recruit people, was a struggle to provide
		the right incentive.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">In Thailand, I&#39;ve observed that many people prefer to run their own business. Even if
		it is a small business selling something in a market. I pressume it provides a different type of
		satisfication.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">This concept of micro-companies appeals to me. I thought about how I could implement
		something like myself.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">I came up with an idea to create multiple micro-companies to handle the various
		tasks.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">For example</span></p>

<ol>
	<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><span style="color:#0e101a">Distribution Company</span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><span style="color:#0e101a">Branding Company&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><span style="color:#0e101a">Sales company</span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><span style="color:#0e101a">Financing Company</span></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">Now that we&#39;ve essentially split a company into four pieces, we are ready to move on
		to the next task.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">&lt;H&gt;Find someone to run these companies.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">Here is the thing, I don&#39;t necessarily think we need someone with a ton of
		distrubtion experience to run company 1. And if we got that guy, it would be way too expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">Instread, I&#39;m leaning towards hiring a highly motivated self starter that is
		passionate about business.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">Why? the only way this will be scalable is if the person can work independantly.</span>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">I value that more than experience in a specific skill set.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">So here are the next few things I start thinking about</span></p>

<ol>
	<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><span style="color:#0e101a">How do I motivate people to join this venture in a
			business they are not familiar with&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:decimal"><span style="color:#0e101a">How can I incentivize them to put their best foot
			forward</span></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">It became clear to me that I needed to create some kind of framework for this. After all,
		if this succeeds I plan to reuse my micro-company model many times over.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">The word framework appeared over and over in my notes. It reminded me of a new
		backtesting framework that I have been lazily working on over the last year or so.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">I&#39;ve recently started considering open sourcing my backtesting
		framework.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">It&#39;s something that intially appeared as a threat to the business. But times are
		changing and we have to adapt along with it. An open source project opens up the code base to bright minds in
		the industry.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">On this same line of thinking, I started questioning, what if there is some way that I
		could open source my talent aquisition framework?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">As these thoughts ruminated, more ideas started coming to mind.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">How can we utilize Blockchain technology to improve our talent acquisition?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">I will post more tomorrow about the crypto side of things.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">Thanks for all the comments and suggestions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">I hope the pivot to a more easy to read style is working - keep the feedback coming
		pls</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">Goals for tommorow - transfer to a temp word press server, enable commenting</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#0e101a">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Update #3</strong> - Feb 7, 2023</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for your feedback. This is a big project and I appreciate all the input</p>
<p>The majority of the feedback indicated that most people didn't understand what I'm trying to do</p>

<p>I can understand that. There is a lot going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>For now, I'll publish a simple statement indicating that we intend to launch a crypto project.</p>

<p>I'll also publish a second article indicating our alternative investment plan for 2023 in the Cannabis industry and how this all ties into our long term strategy.</p>
