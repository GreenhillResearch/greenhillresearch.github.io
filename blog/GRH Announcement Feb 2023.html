<p><strong>Greenhill Research Announces Intentions of Funding a Crypto Project in Thailand</strong> - Feb 7, 2023</p>
<p>The past year has certainly been an interesting one. Many quant firms went under and it was a scary time. We had anticipated bad times to come, and adjusted parameters accordingly.</p>
<p>With some luck and faith, we pulled through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenhill Research posted a gain every month in 2022, despite some major risk events that took place.</p>
<p>Much of this has to do with the way the company is structured in terms of its services. Specifically, the fact that we don't trade our own money.</p>
<p>This led to an entirely different problem. We had cash sitting in our bank, losing purchase power.</p>
<p>I looked into ventures ranging anywhere from Real estate to bonds. They offer decent returns but barely keep up with inflation and don't come anywhere close to matching what I think I am capable of.</p>
<p>I've been pondering the best use of our idle capital for nearly a year now. In that time I've also observed a shift in the marketplace and new emerging trends.</p>
<p>Big tech companies are laying off staff but it doesn't seem like many are extremely eager to look for new jobs.</p>
<p>Rather, I see the post-covid travel trend remains in full effect.</p>
<p>We already struggle to attract good talent. And need to find a solution otherwise we can't grow.<br /></p>
<p>It happens to be that there are a lot of talented individuals in my inner circle. These are self-starters, with a great attitude that I think would give it their all given the opportunity.</p>
<p>I've spent the last few weeks listening to their needs and trying to figure out how to best motivate them. And what kind of innovation we can use to entice them to colloborate with us.<br /></p>
<p>I certainly underestimated this task. But this led me to discover an opportunity.</p>
<p>I'd like to make a open-source framework that facilitates the funding of Entrepreneurs, run on Blockchain.</p>
<p>An MVP of the white paper will be coming in due time. but for now, here is what we are trying to do.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of challenges in connecting Entrepreneurs with the resources they require. And we intend to build a framework around it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamline the process of discovering what motivates the Entrepreneur the most</li>
<li>Facilitate an easy, transparent, and safe way to transfer funds</li>
<li>Smart contracts for KPIs.</li>
<li>Streamline communication amongs team members.</li>
<li>Free collaboration tools</li>
</ul>
<p>I think Thailand is the best place to launch this project. The crypto scene is vibrant and I frequently hear hopeful defi pitches while here.</p>
<p>The infrastructure is what appeals to me the most. I think Thailand is well prepared for the period to come.</p>
<p>I have a meeting scheduled with Thailand's leading crypto exchange, Bitkub, next week. I will be talking with the Board of Investment Thailand while in Bangkok as well.</p>
<p>I hope my upcoming trip will shed some light on the types of tailwinds can expect in terms of regulation.</p>
<p>Greenhill Research will be writing algorithms to trade these tokens. Priority will be given to existing clients. More details on the actions we will take to ensure price stability to follow.</p>
<p>I've already reached out to a handful of people that have shown an interest in the Cannabis industry in Thailand. We are going to make this the test case for the Blockchain project. And I plan to write an article titled "Greenhill Research outperforms the market with alternative investments using an open-source blockchain tool".</p>
<p>Further, I've requested that everyone involved document their experience in some way or another on our new blog. In the interest of transparency, and open-source/Blockchain nature. Also, I think it will make for fantastic content for my site. I know I will enjoy reading it for sure.</p>
<p>I'll do a follow-up next week with more details and an update on my progression. If anyone has any questions or feedback, you know how to contact me.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm ready to write some code.</p>
